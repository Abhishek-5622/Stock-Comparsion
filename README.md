# Stock-Comparsion
The idea of my project is to compare stock details. I have made a project using JavaScript , node.js and puppeteer.
Go to the bseindia website. Then enter the name of the stock .All the main details of the stock are stored in json file. A excel file is also created for the better
comparison of all details with current value, fluctuation percentage, the high, low of the day, etc.
Details are sorted in excel in such a way that at the top, the stock name is showing which is more profitable. 
After this, the excel file will be automatically sent to the concerned client through mail.
